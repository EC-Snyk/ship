## Ship Config

This is the reference documentation for Ship config. It is largely shared with the Replicated config described [here](https://help.replicated.com/docs/config-screen/config-yaml/). Config allows you to collect settings from end-users that will be available through template functions to use in assets and lifecycle steps.
